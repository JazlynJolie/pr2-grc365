        <h2>Quebec City</h2>
        <p>
           The average high temperature in Quebec City in March is 33 degrees Fahrenheit, with a low of aroundtemperature in Quebec City in March is 33 degrees Fahrenheit, with a low of around 18.
           That's apparently of no consequence to the locals, whom chosen the month for an outdoor music festival appropriately dubbed igloofest. 
           The annunt event, billed as "the coldest music festhal in the world", is an opportunity for Quebécois music lovers so flex their winter gear, with revelers in full-body ski suits, snow goggles, and what appears so be the most advanced outdoor apparel on the market.

           Kaytranada, this year's headliner, arrives backstage around 8 p.m. wearing black Celine sweatpants and Balenciaga wraparound sunglasies. 
           He's flanked on either side by his mom and sister, as well as a bevy of crew members trailing as he beads toward the main stage for his set. 
           While he's well-known as a maestro of dance floors acroes the world, he tells me later on that he's only recently started working regularly with CDJs, a standard tool used by live DJs to play digital manic in their sets. "I just got tired of carrying my laptop around," he says.
           "I wanted so look more like a DJ."

      <h2>Growing Up</h2>
      <p>Kaytranada grew up in Saint-Hubert, just outside of Montreal. A middle child in the family, he showed musical talent early on.
         After he graduated high school, he was invited to a beat competition called Artbeat Montreal, which he ended up winning.
         Soon after, he'd make a name for himself playing shows around his hometown alongside his brother.
         They started out as a classic rapper-producer duo and went by the name the Celestics, a play on their last name, Celestin.
      </p>
      <p>
         It didn't take long for Kay's beats to be recognized as coming from somewhere out of this planet.
         Even Among the EDM-centric pop production of the 2010s, something about his sound stood apart. 
         There was a more energetic swing, a syncopation rooted in history, an irresistible danceability.
         Before long, he was the main event, playing local clubs and parties around Canada.
